In this project, we try to implement a garbage collector for C programs which work on **the principle of reachability of objects** to detect memory leaks. Through this project, we understand the limitation of such a garbage collector for C like programming languages (which have direct access to underlying memory addresses, unlike Java/python) and analyze its limitations and cost for being an inbuilt feature of C-like language.
